## welcome to d0lmany <img src="lol.svg" width="45" height="45">
I'm a college student and I have a lot of ideas, but not a lot of time to implement them. My goal is to get fabulously rich and not deny myself anything, and of course I also like coding.  
### my stack and tools:
- **frontend**: HTML, CSS, JS, Vue.js 3, jQuery, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap 5
- **backend**: PHP, MySQL, SQLite, MSSQL
- **app coding**: C#, XAML
- **other**: Git, OOP
  
### my projects
- **utilities** - little things that simplify my life a little 
- **StudWork** - student project: an aggregator for finding a place for academic practice and internship
- **web_legacy** - my old websites (not tracked)
